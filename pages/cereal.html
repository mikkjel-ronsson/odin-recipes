        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk - however much you want of whichever kind you want.</li>
                <li>Cereal - again - whatever you want. IDGAF, bro.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Get a bowl. It can be clean, dirty, new, whatever. Just get something to pour things into</li>
                <li>Pour cereal in to bowl. Feed yourself.</li>
                <li>Add milk. Some like it soggy, some like it with crunch. Figure out what you like best</li>
                <li>When the food is gone, drink the remaining milk like it's the soul of your vanquished foe. <strong>WASTE NOTHING.</strong></li>
                <li>Leave empty bowl in your sink to clean later, when, you know, there's more dishes or something</li>
            </ol>
